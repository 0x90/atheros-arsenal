This is the jaldimac kernel driver. Not currently functional, but more 
documentation will be added once the driver is in a working state.

Getting JaldiMAC to compile under OpenWRT
=========================================
This assumes you are able to build OpenWRT from source already. I've only 
tested with Backfire, and I make no guarantees that it will work with anything 
but my specific buildroot (but it probably will).

First, create a directory called "jaldi" under backfire/packages. Rename 
OpeNWRT_Makefile to Makefile and drop it in here. You need to modify this file 
to reflect the location of wherever you have the source for JaldiMAC located on 
your machine. Edit line 41 (under Build/Prepare) to point to this. In the 
future, this will all be automated in keeping with the spirit of the OpenWRT 
build system, but for now copying the source into the build_dir on every build 
makes development a bit easier.

After this you should be good to go. Go into 'make menuconfig' and select the 
kmod-jaldi package under Kernel Modules > Wireless Drivers. Compile it as 
normal.

If you're hacking on jaldi and want to just rebuild the jaldi package and 
create an updated image to flash onto your device, just run 'make 
package/jaldi-{clean,compile,install} ; make target/install' (assuming you've 
selected the kmod-jaldi package to begin with, of course).
