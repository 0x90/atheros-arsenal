- Add support for bulk ACKs - or, indeed, any ACKs at all!
- Make a drop front variant of JaldiQueue for use with VoIP flows.
- Make JaldiScheduler create the layout online instead of being an offline algorithm; this will enable better VoIP performance. (The current arrangement of inserting VoIP packets from upstream into the downstream transmissions dynamically in the fake driver is only a temporary hack.)
- Complete this TODO list. =)
