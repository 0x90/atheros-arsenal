These are the Click elements and Click configurations that make up the JaldiMAC
implementation.

For this to build, the following must already be installed:

- GNU build tools (gcc, autotools, make, etc.)
- The Click modular router
- Graphviz

To build, type "make". To remove the generated files from a previous build,
type "make clean". The "dist" directory will contain the useful build products;
for each master and station, there are:

- "clickpkg" files: these are actually ar archives, and can be loaded just as
  if they were a standalone configuration by the Click tools; they contain all
  of the custom JaldiMAC elements in addition to a Click configuration matching
  the name of the package.
- "pdf" files: these are visualizations of each Click configuration, generated
  by click-pretty and dot.
