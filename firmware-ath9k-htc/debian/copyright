Upstream-Name: The firmware for QCA AR7010/AR9271 802.11n USB NICs
Source: https://github.com/qca/open-ath9k-htc-firmware/
Files-Excluded: sboot/* docs/*
Comment: Directories sboot/ and docs/ of upstream repository contain binary
 objects that are useful for reference and in-depth debugging purposes only
 and are not needed to generate a firmware image, hence they're removed
 during repacking to provide a DFSG-compliant tarball of original sources.
