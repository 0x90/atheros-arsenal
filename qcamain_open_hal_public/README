This is a public version of the AR9300 HAL, suitable for open source
development.


What is this?
-------------

This is a public version of the QCA mainline (10.x) development HAL.
It has a few notable changes:

* The boolean types have been converted back to the HAL types
  (HAL_BOOL, AH_TRUE / AH_FALSE) to aid integration into the existing
  open source Atheros HAL drivers;

* Some features have been removed from this HAL.

However, this is essentially the same HAL which is used in QCA development
and forms the basis for public releases from the 10.x mainline.

Subsequent HAL releases will be committed on top of this release in order
to provide developers with a simple change history they can use when
doing branch merging.
