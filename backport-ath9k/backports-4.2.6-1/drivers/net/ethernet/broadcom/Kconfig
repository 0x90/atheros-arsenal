	  If you have a network (Ethernet) chipset belonging to this class,
	  say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect
	  the kernel: saying N will just case the configurator to skip all
	  the questions regarding AMD chipsets. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific chipset/driver in the following questions.
