config WLCORE
	tristate "TI wlcore support"
	depends on m
	depends on WL_TI && MAC80211
	depends on FW_LOADER
	---help---
	  This module contains the main code for TI WLAN chips.  It abstracts
	  hardware-specific differences among different chipset families.
	  Each chipset family needs to implement its own lower-level module
	  that will depend on this module for the common code.

	  If you choose to build a module, it will be called wlcore. Say N if
	  unsure.

config WLCORE_SPI
	tristate "TI wlcore SPI support"
	depends on m
	depends on WLCORE && SPI_MASTER
	depends on CRC7
	---help---
	  This module adds support for the SPI interface of adapters using
	  TI WLAN chipsets.  Select this if your platform is using
	  the SPI bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called wlcore_spi.
	  Say N if unsure.

config WLCORE_SDIO
	depends on !KERNEL_3_15
	tristate "TI wlcore SDIO support"
	depends on m
	depends on WLCORE && MMC
	---help---
	  This module adds support for the SDIO interface of adapters using
	  TI WLAN chipsets.  Select this if your platform is using
	  the SDIO bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called wlcore_sdio.
	  Say N if unsure.
